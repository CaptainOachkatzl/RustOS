VS Code extensions:
"C/C++"
"Cargo"
"Rust"


used commands to get setup to run:

in project directory: "rustup override add nightly"     # need additional features from the nightly build
"rustc --version"   # to check if nightly build was successfully deployed
"cargo install cargo-xbuild"    # to install the cross compiler version
"rustup component add rust-src"     # to add rust source code which the cross compiler relies on (kinda obvious we cant use precompiled stuff here)
"cargo xbuild" to build the kernel
"cargo install bootimage"   # installing the bootloader and the linker between kernel and bootloader
"rustup component add llvm-tools-preview"   # linker tools for the bootloader above
"cargo bootimage"   # create a bootable image by linking together bootloader and kernel
"dd if=target/x86_64-rust_os/debug/bootimage-rust_os.bin of=/dev/sdX && sync" to write bootable image to USB
"cargo xrun"    # to build and run on QEMU
"cargo xtest"   # to run the test suite
